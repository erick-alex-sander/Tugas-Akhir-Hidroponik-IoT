# Tugas-Akhir-Hidroponik-IoT

This is my final year project in Engineering Physics program. This program creates IoT system for Hydroponic to ease the hydroponic monitoring. This project uses MQTT (Message-Queueing Transport Telemetry) as a protocol. Sensors used for this project are:
- pH meter
- EC 'Electro Conductivity' meter
- DHT22 for measuring air temperature and humidity
- DS18b20 for measuring the temperature of water solution
- Flowmter for measuring the debit of the water solution

The project has been submitted and evaluated, yet the project still needs improvement. To-do list of this project are:
1. Arduino-client side (only retrieving code from Lab)
2. Server side
⋅⋅1. Data-Fetching code
